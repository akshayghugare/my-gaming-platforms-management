/**
 * Central API router. Every per-resource router gets mounted here under
 * its `/api/...` prefix, so `app.ts` only has to wire one thing:
 *
 *   app.use("/api", apiRouter);
 *
 * Add a new resource by:
 *   1. dropping its `*.routes.ts` file in this folder
 *   2. importing it below and appending an entry to `apiRoutes`.
